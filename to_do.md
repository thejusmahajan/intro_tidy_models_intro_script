# Restructure
- Core packages are give all at one - may cause concern within the noob community.

- The structure may be confusing. Think of a better organisation?

- May be the packages lising parsnip ... rsample be moved to the end?

- I think recipe should be introduced first.

- And one model at a time! This is the tidymodel philosophy!!!
